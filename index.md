**Links**

Links are created using the <a> element.

X The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate

the page you are linking to.

X If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

X You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.

X You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.



**Layout**

 <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

X Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

X The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

X Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

X Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

X Grids help create professional and flexible designs. X CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks. X You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
